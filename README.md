# Hi!!


<h1>Welcome</h1>
<li>I am a Newbie.</li>
<br>
<br>

This will be my **FIRST** time using github and I'am Excited to embark on a *New Journey.*  
<br>
<br>
I am following the ***QuickStart*** guide from [***Github Docs***](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).
<br>
<br>
Please do inform if there are any errors.
<br>
<br>
Currently I am working on creating a website based of a template by following a freecodecamp Youtube Video.<br>
I will be updating the details soon.
